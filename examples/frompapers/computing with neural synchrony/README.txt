These are Brian scripts corresponding to the following paper:

Brette R (2012). Computing with neural synchrony. PLoS Comp Biol. 8(6): e1002561. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002561

Files are organized by topic. There can be dependencies within folders, but not across folders.
A few scripts need to be run in a specific order, but this is specified in the header of the files.
Note that a few simulations are very long (mostly the STDP ones).
